## ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded the dataset containing 9 columns and 9827 rows.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for null and duplicate values (none found).  
   - Converted `Release_Date` into datetime and extracted release year.  
   - Dropped less useful columns: `Overview`, `Original_Language`, `Poster_Url`.  
   - Handled `Genre` column by splitting comma-separated values and exploding them into individual rows.  
   - Converted `Genre` into categorical data type.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new column `Release_year`.  
   - Categorized `Vote_Average` into 4 groups:  
     - **Not Popular**  
     - **Below Average**  
     - **Average**  
     - **Popular**  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked distribution of vote categories.  
   - Visualized vote averages with `Seaborn`.  
   - Identified the movie with the **highest popularity** and its genre.
